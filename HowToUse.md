# Introduction #

  1. Browse to a Google search like the following:
> http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=car+insurance&gl=uk

> 2) You should see a regular Google search page plus some extra links at the top. Also, some of the ads on the side and at the top should have coloured links.

What are the colored links?

These are ads that use third-party tracking. This means that when you click on the ad you go to the tracking website, and then are redirected to the actual website. Each color represents a different tracking system (or even one user of a tracking system). If you mouve your mouse over a colored link you can see a tooltip which tells you which tracking system (or user) it is.
What are the extra links at the top?

Clicking one of these links will take you to a search for your current search (in this case "car insurance") on different search engines or locales. This allows you to quickly see the competition for a certain keyword in different locations and on different search engines. Choosing a location without much competition could mean cheaper clicks.
What is a locale?

A locale is a local version of the search engine eg. Google UK, Google China etc.. The links for Google are slightly modified so that you can see ads for that locale. The gl=uk parameter in the link above tells Google to show ads for the United Kingdom market. Otherwise, searching for car insurance on google.com will show ads for your location, not the same ads you would see if you do the search from the UK.

> 3) You can turn the ad highlighting on and off by clicking the "AD" button on the statusbar. If the Ad Highlighter is turned on it will show whenever you go to one of the default sites. If you are not at the default site you can still highlight the ads on that page by clicking this button.

> 4) You can turn the search engine links on and off by clicking the "links" button (a triangle of inter connected circles) on the status bar.

> 5) The third button (a bunch of numbers) is the Ad Counter button. This shows you a count of all the ads that you have seen from each tracking system. It also has links to the websites of each tracking company. This button is disabled by default.
